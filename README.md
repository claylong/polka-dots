# polka-dots
A prototype layout and style used to calculate the perfect distribution
of polkadots in a traditional pattern.

## Use
The HTML is hardcoded for the number of rows and columns.  The CSS
has the two main adjustable variables at the top which can be edited
to adjust the layout.

## ToDo
Make the HTML layout dynamic using javascript, and make more of the 
CSS configurable.
